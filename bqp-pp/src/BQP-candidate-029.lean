# The composite machine outputs the composition

`ShiTM2.comp tm1 tm2 tr dflt` (`Definitions/Def_ShiTM2_Composite.lean`) runs `tm1` on its input
stack, moves `tm1`'s output stack onto `tm2`'s input stack through a scratch stack, and then runs
`tm2`.  This file is the **chaining**: if `tm1` outputs `t` on `s` within `m1` steps and `tm2`
outputs `u` on `t.map tr` within `m2` steps, then the composite outputs `u` on `s` within
`m1 + (2 * t.length + 2) + m2` steps.  No polynomial arithmetic and no
`Turing.TM2ComputableInPolyTime` structure is built here; both are separate.

The run is assembled from three accepted platform theorems, one per phase, plus the two
configuration-law bundles:

1. `ShiTM.iterate_compM_one_simulation` -- phase 1, step-exact, `N1` steps;
2. `ShiTM.copy_phase_transfers_output_state` -- phase 2, exactly `2 * t.length + 2` steps;
3. `ShiTM.iterate_compM_two_simulation` -- phase 3, step-exact, `N2` steps.

`N1` and `N2` are the *actual* step counts recorded in the `StateTransition.EvalsTo.steps` fields
of the two hypotheses, not the bounds `m1`/`m2`; the bounds re-enter only at the very end through
`steps_le_m`.

## What is not supplied by any ingredient, and had to be proved here

Both iteration lemmas require `hlive`: the simulated component has not halted at any `j < n`.
`Turing.TM2OutputsInTime` does not give this.  `shiAsm_no_early_death` derives it.  The argument
is: a `none` state is a fixed point of the one-step map on `Option`, so if the `j`-th iterate were
`none`, or were `some` of a configuration with label `none` (in which case the `(j+1)`-st iterate
is `none`, because `Turing.TM2.step` of a halted configuration is `none`), then every later
iterate -- in particular the `n`-th -- would be `none`, contradicting that the `n`-th iterate is
`some`.  Persistence needs no `Nat.le_induction`: from `i <= n` write `n = d + i` with `d` obtained
*opaquely*, and `Function.iterate_add_apply` plus `shiAsm_iterate_none` finish it.

One statement serves **both** phases: it never constrains the final configuration's label, so
phase 3's "the component may halt at the last step" needs no separate version.

## The three configuration matchings

All three are `Turing.TM2.Cfg` extensionality (`shiAsm_cfg_ext`: three field equalities, `funext`
on `stk`, and Lean 4 structure eta for `c = <c.l, c.var, c.stk>`).  Nothing deeper was needed.

* **Entry.**  `Turing.initList (comp ..) s` is the `liftCfg1`-lift of `Turing.initList tm1 s`
  against the empty background.  `l`: `Option.elim` on `some tm1.main` is iota.  `var`:
  `ShiTM2.compInitialState` *is* `(tm1.initialState, tm2.initialState, none)`, so the `liftCfg1`
  state `(c.var, tm2.initialState, none)` matches on the nose.  `stk`: the three per-key facts of
  `ShiTM.initList_haltList_comp`.
* **Phase 1 to phase 2 (the halt redirection).**  `Turing.haltList tm1 t` has label `none`, and
  `liftCfg1` sends `none` to the *live* label `lcopyA` -- which is why phase 2 can start at all.
  Only the `l` field needs an argument; `var` and `stk` are taken as projections of the very
  configuration being rewritten, hence `rfl`.
* **Phase 2 to phase 3, and phase 3 to `haltList`.**  The register conjunct
  `v' = (v.1, v.2.1, none)` of `ShiTM.copy_phase_transfers_output_state` is what pins all three
  coordinates of the internal state: phase 3 cannot *start* without `v'.2.1 = tm2.initialState`
  (its start state must be `Turing.initList tm2 (t.map tr)`'s, namely `tm2.initialState`), and it
  cannot *land* on `Turing.haltList (comp ..) u` without `v'.1 = tm1.initialState` and
  `v'.2.2 = none`, since `Turing.haltList` pins the final state to `(comp ..).initialState`.
  The weaker `ShiTM.copy_phase_transfers_output`, whose `v'` is unconstrained, does not chain.

## The two transparency hazards, and how each is answered

`ShiTM2.CompGamma tm1 tm2 (injK1 .. i)` is `tm1.Gamma i` by `rfl`, but only at *default*
transparency, because `CompGamma` is a reducible `abbrev` over a semireducible `Sum.elim`.

1. **No rewriting tactic ever traverses a hypothesis whose type mentions a `CompGamma`-indexed
   `List.map`.**  The transfer conclusion `S' (injK2 .. tm2.k0) = (Sm (injK1 .. tm1.k1)).map tr` is
   consumed only by `Eq.trans` and `congrArg`, and the arithmetic bridge
   `(Sm (injK1 .. tm1.k1)).length = t.length` is applied on the *goal*.  Both `Sm` and `S'` are
   opaque locals introduced by `obtain` from an existential, so every hypothesis stated about them
   is `CompGamma`-free in the dangerous position.  There is no `++` anywhere in this file.
2. **No dependent function is ever handed across the two spellings.**  `ShiTM2.liftStk1` is never
   applied by hand -- the stack family is always taken as `(ShiTM2.liftCfg1 ..).stk`, a projection
   -- so the application check that would compare `forall k, List (tm1.Gamma k)` against
   `forall i, List (CompGamma .. (injK1 .. i))` never runs.

## Why the conclusion is `Nonempty`

`StateTransition.EvalsToInTime` (`Computability/StateTransition.lean:265`) is a structure in
`Type`, not a `Prop`: it *carries* the step count.  So `Turing.TM2OutputsInTime` is data, a
`theorem` cannot return it, and -- the knock-on -- no `∃` could be destructured while the goal
was `Type`-valued (`Exists.casesOn` eliminates only into `Prop`).  Wrapping the conclusion in
`Nonempty` fixes both at once, and loses nothing: the eventual target is itself `Nonempty`
(`PvsNP.PolyTimeComputable f := Nonempty (TM2ComputableInPolyTime id id f)`,
`Definitions/Def_PvsNP.lean:71`), so a later file recovers the data with `Classical.choice`
exactly as Mathlib's own `idComputableInPolyTime` does inside a `noncomputable section`.

## `noConfusion` is unusable here; the named `_ne_` lemmas are not

`Option.noConfusion` and `Sum.noConfusion` want their motive at `Sort (u + 2)`, and
`CompK tm₁ tm₂`, `tm₁.Λ` and friends all sit in `Type 0`, so the universe constraint is
unsatisfiable.  `Option.some_ne_none` (`Init/Data/Option/Lemmas.lean:31`), `Sum.inl_ne_inr`
(`Init/Data/Sum/Lemmas.lean:103`) and `Sum.inr_ne_inl` (`:105`) are all `nofun` and carry no
such constraint.

## The instance mismatch at the final `exact`

`Turing.TM2OutputsInTime (comp ..) ..` unfolds to `StateTransition.EvalsToInTime (comp ..).step ..`,
and `(comp ..).step` carries `Turing.FinTM2.decidableEqK (comp ..)`
(`Computability/TuringMachine/Computable.lean:80`, an honest `instance`).  Every accepted
ingredient instead carries the *free variable* `inst` of the `[DecidableEq (CompK tm1 tm2)]`
binder, and an `fvar` is not definitionally equal to `decidableEqK (comp ..)`, so the closing
`exact` fails and `show` cannot repair it.  `shiAsm_decEq_unique` (decidable equality is a
subsingleton, `funext` plus core's `Subsingleton (Decidable p)`) gives the propositional equality,
and `subst` then retypes every derived hypothesis without re-elaborating any of them -- which is
also why `subst`, and not `rw .. at`, is the right tool given hazard 1 above.

/-! ### Configuration extensionality

Three field equalities determine a `Turing.TM2.Cfg`.  Stated at generic types, where no
`Sum.elim` is in scope, and applied by `refine`/`exact`, which check at default transparency. -/

/-! ### `none` is a fixed point of the one-step map

`Turing.TM2.step` of a halted configuration is `none` (`StackTuringMachine.lean:171-173`) and a
`none` state cannot be revived, so a machine that is dead at step `j` is dead at every later step.
This is what refutes the two bad branches of `shiAsm_no_early_death`. -/

/-- Every iterate of the one-step map fixes `none`. -/

      | (simp only [Function.iterate_succ_apply, Option.bind_none]
         exact ih
         done)

/-- **No early death.**  If `n` steps carry the live configuration `<some l, v, S>` to *some*
configuration, then at every intermediate time `j < n` the machine is still live: the `j`-th
iterate is `some` of a configuration whose label is `some`.

This is exactly the `hlive` hypothesis that `ShiTM.iterate_compM_one_simulation` and
`ShiTM.iterate_compM_two_simulation` demand and that `Turing.TM2OutputsInTime` does not supply.
The conclusion says nothing about the final configuration `c`, so the same statement serves
phase 1 (where the component's own halt is redirected) and phase 3 (where the component may halt
at the last step, its halt being the composite's). -/

/-! ### Decidable equality is a subsingleton

`Turing.FinTM2` carries `kDecidableEq` as a *field*, and `Turing.FinTM2.decidableEqK`
(`Computable.lean:80`) is the instance derived from it; the accepted composite theorems instead
take `[DecidableEq (CompK tm1 tm2)]` as a binder.  The two are propositionally, not
definitionally, equal, and the closing `exact` needs them identified. -/

/-! ### The three-phase chaining -/

/--
**The sequential composite of two bundled `TM2` machines outputs the composition of what they
output, in the sum of their running times plus the cost of the transfer.**

If `tm₁` run on `s` outputs `t` within `m₁` steps, and `tm₂` run on `t.map tr` outputs `u` within
`m₂` steps, then `ShiTM2.comp tm₁ tm₂ tr dflt` run on `s` outputs `u` within
`m₁ + (2 * t.length + 2) + m₂` steps.  The middle summand is exact: the transfer phase pops and
pushes each of the `t.length` symbols twice, once per pass over the scratch stack, plus the two
failing pops that end the passes.

This is the correctness half of Mathlib's `proof_wanted Turing.TM2ComputableInPolyTime.comp`
(`Computability/TuringMachine/Computable.lean:284`) for the identity encoding: it says the
exhibited machine really does compute the composition.  The polynomial bound on
`m₁ + (2 * |f a| + 2) + m₂`, which needs `|f a|` to be polynomially bounded, and the assembly of
the `TM2ComputableInPolyTime` structure are separate.

The conclusion is `Nonempty` of the run rather than the run itself because
`Turing.TM2OutputsInTime` unfolds to a structure in `Type` -- it carries the step count -- and a
`theorem` must be a proposition.  This is the shape the downstream target wants anyway:
`PvsNP.PolyTimeComputable` is itself a `Nonempty`.
