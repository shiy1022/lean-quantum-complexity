Operator (matrix) layer for shallow quantum circuits -- DEFINITIONS ONLY.

This bundle EXTENDS the published `ShiShallow_Core` definition bundle rather than
duplicating it: it imports that module and reuses exactly `Bits`, `Instr` (with its five constructors),
`Layered`, and the one-qubit matrices `hMat`, `sMat`, `tMat`, `xMat`. It does NOT use that
bundle's `QState` or `apply1`: `apply1Matrix` below is built directly from `Matrix.of` and
takes an arbitrary `U`, so nothing here connects the matrix layer to the state-vector
semantics. No name from that bundle is redefined here, so the two may be imported together
and a theorem may mix the two layers.

Every public theorem has been REMOVED so that none is buried inside a definition entry (a
lemma published inside a definition bundle can never afterwards be submitted as a theorem --
its name is already declared in the environment). Those lemmas are submitted separately.

Built against Mathlib (Apache-2.0) at revision 0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474.

# Operator layer: matrices of gates, layers and circuits

For each instruction, layer and layered circuit this bundle gives the induced operator on
the `2 ^ n`-dimensional state space, indexed by basis strings, together with a locality
predicate `IsLocal S A` expressing `A = A_S ⊗ I` without tensor products, and the projector
`projOut` onto a chosen output wire being `1`.

DEFINITIONS ONLY -- no theorem is exported. In particular nothing here proves that
`gateMatrix`, `layerMatrix` or `circMatrix` is unitary, that they agree with the
state-vector semantics `Instr.apply`/`runLayer`/`runLayered` of `ShiShallow_Core`, that
`IsLocal` is closed under products, that `projOut` is idempotent or `{out}`-local, or that
any matrix here is `IsLocal` for any wire set at all -- `IsLocal` is defined but never
applied within this bundle.

CAVEAT, inherited and documented at the declaration: `cnotMatrix i j` takes NO hypothesis
`i ≠ j`, and at `i = j` it is rank-deficient -- not CNOT and not unitary. `gateMatrix` holds
such a hypothesis inside the `Instr.cnot` constructor but discards it when calling
`cnotMatrix`, so nothing in the types enforces distinctness.

Matrix products are REVERSED relative to application order: gates in a layer apply left to
right, so `layerMatrix (g :: t) = layerMatrix t * gateMatrix g`, and likewise for circuits.

/-- Overwrite `v` on `S` with the values carried by `w`. -/
-- NOTE: `graft` is not consumed by any other definition in this bundle. It reconstructs a
-- full basis string from a restriction, which is precisely the operation `IsLocal`'s

    (w : {k : Fin n // k ∈ S} → Bool) : Bits n :=
  fun k => if h : k ∈ S then w ⟨k, h⟩ else v k

/-- `A` acts as the identity outside `S`: entries vanish unless the two basis strings agree
off `S`, and otherwise depend only on the restrictions to `S`. This is the tensor-product
condition `A = A_S ⊗ I`, written without tensor products.

Stated as a conjunction rather than as `∃ B, ...` because both halves get used directly by
the conjugation lemmas of the wider development, where reconstructing a full basis string from
a restriction would otherwise be needed inside a double sum. NOTE: those lemmas are NOT in
this bundle -- it exports no theorem -- so within this file the choice of formulation has no
justification a reader can check here. -/

/-- Matrix of CNOT (control `i`, target `j`), written so that `{i,j}`-locality is manifest.

CAVEAT: unlike `cnotState`, this definition takes NO `i ≠ j` hypothesis, and at `i = j` it is
NOT the CNOT matrix: the predicate collapses to `z i = y i ∧ z i = false`, whose only nonzero
entries have `y i = z i = false`, giving a rank-deficient and non-unitary matrix. Callers must
supply `i ≠ j` themselves. `gateMatrix` does hold such a hypothesis inside the `Instr.cnot`
constructor but discards it when calling this definition, so nothing in the types enforces
it. -/

Written with `Fin.append`. The imported core bundle separately defines `inputState`, which
encodes the same data in a different way; NO lemma anywhere relates the two, and nothing in
this bundle consumes `padIn`. -/

/-- The measurement observable: the projector onto `out = 1`, as a diagonal 0/1 matrix.
No property of it is proved here -- in particular neither idempotence nor `IsLocal {out}`,
though both are true. `IsLocal` is never applied to any matrix in this bundle. -/
