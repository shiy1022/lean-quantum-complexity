# The sequential composite of two `Turing.FinTM2` machines

Mathlib records `proof_wanted Turing.TM2ComputableInPolyTime.comp`
(`Mathlib/Computability/TuringMachine/Computable.lean:284`): the composite of two
polynomial-time bundled stack machines computes the composite function in polynomial time.
The informal recipe in that docstring is "one tape for each tape in both of the composed TMs;
run the first, copy its output tape onto the second's input tape, run the second".  A proof
has to **exhibit** that machine, which is data, so it cannot be built inside a theorem file
that is meant to be published as a theorem.  This file is that data and nothing else.

## The machine

Given `tm₁ tm₂ : Turing.FinTM2`, a symbol translation `tr : tm₁.Γ tm₁.k₁ → tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀`
between the output alphabet of the first machine and the input alphabet of the second, and a
default symbol `dflt : tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀`:

* stacks `CompK = tm₁.K ⊕ tm₂.K ⊕ Unit` -- both machines' stacks, plus one scratch stack whose
  alphabet is `tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀`;
* labels `CompΛ = tm₁.Λ ⊕ tm₂.Λ ⊕ Bool` -- both machines' labels, plus two labels `lcopyA`
  (`false`) and `lcopyB` (`true`) for the two copy passes;
* internal state `Compσ = tm₁.σ × tm₂.σ × Option (tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀)` -- both machines' states, plus
  a one-symbol transfer register;
* `k₀ = injK₁ tm₁.k₀`, `k₁ = injK₂ tm₂.k₁`, `main = injΛ₁ tm₁.main`.

A run of `comp tm₁ tm₂ tr dflt` has three phases:

1. **`tm₁`, relabelled** (`trStmt₁`).  Each stack index `k` becomes `injK₁ k`, each label `l`
   becomes `injΛ₁ l`, the internal state is projected in and out of the first component, and --
   the point of the exercise -- `Stmt.halt` becomes `Stmt.goto (fun _ => lcopyA)`.
2. **The copy phase** (`copyA`, `copyB`).  `copyA` pops `injK₁ tm₁.k₁` into the transfer
   register (applying `tr`) and pushes onto the scratch stack; `copyB` pops the scratch stack
   and pushes onto `injK₂ tm₂.k₀`, then `goto (injΛ₂ tm₂.main)`.  Two passes because a single
   pop/push pass reverses the list.
3. **`tm₂`, relabelled** (`trStmt₂`).  As phase 1 with `injK₂`/`injΛ₂` and the second state
   component, except that `Stmt.halt` stays `Stmt.halt`: the composite really does halt here.

## Three points where the design is forced

* **The halt redirection.**  `Turing.TM2.step M ⟨none, _, _⟩ = none`
  (`StackTuringMachine.lean:171-173`): a halted TM2 is *dead* and cannot be resumed.  So the
  first machine's program cannot be reused verbatim; its `halt` leaves must be rewritten to a
  `goto`.  This is the whole reason `trStmt₁` exists, and the reason `trStmt₁ ≠ trStmt₂`.
* **The phase marker lives in `Λ`, not in `σ`.**  `Turing.haltList`
  (`Computable.lean:118-123`) pins the final internal state to `tm.initialState`.  A
  σ-resident phase flag would have to be reset before halting; `Λ` is unconstrained at halt.
  With the marker in `Λ`, the final state is `(tm₁.initialState, tm₂.initialState, none)`,
  which is exactly `compInitialState`, because `tm₁`'s own halting state is `tm₁.initialState`
  (phase 1 leaves component 1 there), `tm₂`'s is `tm₂.initialState`, and the register is
  emptied by the last, failing, pop of `copyB`.
* **`Stmt.push k (f : σ → Γ k)` is total** (`StackTuringMachine.lean:128`), so every push must
  name a symbol even on branches that are never taken -- here the branch where the transfer
  register is empty.  `Turing.FinTM2` carries no `Inhabited (Γ k)` for any `k`, and
  `tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀` can genuinely be empty, so a symbol has to come from outside: the explicit
  parameter `dflt`.  It is taken explicitly rather than as `[Inhabited (tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀)]`
  because no instance for `tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀` can ever be *found* by typeclass search (the
  `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` fields of `Turing.FinTM2` are structure fields, not instances --
  which is why Mathlib has to declare `Turing.FinTM2.decidableEqK` by hand,
  `Computable.lean:80-81`), so an instance binder would only force `@`-applications at every
  call site.  `dflt` is used *only* in the two unreachable push branches: it never appears in
  the output of a well-formed run.

## What is NOT here

This file contains **no theorem and no lemma**, not even a `private` one, and makes no claim
whatsoever about the behaviour of the machine it defines.  In particular none of the following
is stated or proved here:

1. that `comp tm₁ tm₂ tr dflt` computes `g ∘ f` when `tm₁` computes `f` and `tm₂` computes
   `g` -- the entire correctness claim;
2. that any phase of the run does what the prose above says: no simulation lemma for
   `trStmt₁`/`trStmt₂`, no transfer lemma for `copyA`/`copyB`, no step count;
3. that `liftStk₁`/`liftStk₂` commute with `Function.update` (the `Function.rec_update`
   application, `Mathlib/Logic/Function/Basic.lean:745`), nor that `injK₁`, `injK₂`, `injΛ₁`,
   `injΛ₂` are injective, nor that the three stack blocks are pairwise disjoint;
4. that `Turing.initList (comp ..) s` is the `liftStk₁`-lift of `Turing.initList tm₁ s`, or
   that `Turing.haltList (comp ..) t` is the `liftStk₂`-lift of `Turing.haltList tm₂ t`.
   Both `initList` and `haltList` are defined by a dependent `dite` that transports along an
   equality of stack indices, so these are real obligations, not `rfl`;
5. any time bound.  `comp` has no `time` field: `Turing.FinTM2` carries none.  The polynomial
   arithmetic, and the bound on the length of the intermediate string, are separate;
6. that `tr` is a bijection or that it is compatible with any encoding.  `tr` is an arbitrary
   function here; a caller composing `TM2ComputableInPolyTime` structures will instantiate it
   with `fun x => h₂.inputAlphabet.symm (h₁.outputAlphabet x)`
   (`Computable.lean:151-153`), but nothing in this file needs or records that;
7. that `dflt` is irrelevant.  `comp tm₁ tm₂ tr dflt` depends on `dflt` syntactically; the
   fact that no reachable configuration of a well-formed run reads it is a theorem.

Design decisions that a reader should check before building on this file:

* The alphabet family of the source machine is used in its **restricted** form
  `fun i => CompΓ tm₁ tm₂ (injK₁ tm₁ tm₂ i)`, which is *definitionally* `tm₁.Γ i` because
  `CompΓ` is a `Sum.elim` and `injK₁` is `Sum.inl`.  This is what lets the stack lifts have
  the type `((i : ι) → α (ctor i)) → ((i : κ) → α i)` that `Function.rec_update` demands, with
  no `Equiv`, no `List.map` and no cast anywhere.  Had the composite alphabet been an
  independent family with equivalences to `tm₁.Γ`/`tm₂.Γ`, every `push` and `pop` would carry
  a transport and the lifts would have the wrong type.
* The stack lifts take the background stacks as an **explicit first argument**
  (`liftStk₁ tm₁ tm₂ T`), so that the partially applied `liftStk₁ tm₁ tm₂ T` is a concrete
  function with a constant head.  A lift characterised only by hypotheses
  (`L S (injK₁ i) = S i`) leaves a metavariable in the head position and
  `Function.rec_update` then fails to unify.
* The two copy labels are indexed by `Bool` rather than `Fin 2`, because `false`/`true` are
  constructors and so usable as match patterns, whereas `(0 : Fin 2)` is an `OfNat` literal.
  Nothing else changes.

argument.  The background stacks `T` come first, so that `liftStk₁ tm₁ tm₂ T` is a concrete
partial application: a lift described only by hypotheses leaves a metavariable in head
position and `rec_update` will not unify with it. -/

/-! ### Finiteness

The `DecidableEq`/`Fintype` fields of `Turing.FinTM2` are structure fields, not instances, so
they have to be fed to typeclass search by hand (`letI`) before the corresponding instance for
the sum/product can be found.  `Turing.FinTM2` provides `Fintype (Γ k₀)` only -- not
`Fintype (Γ k₁)`, not `∀ k, Fintype (Γ k)` -- and that is exactly enough here: the composite's
input alphabet is `tm₁.Γ tm₁.k₀` and its internal state mentions `tm₂.Γ tm₂.k₀`. -/

/-- **The composite machine.**  Runs `tm₁` on its input stack, copies `tm₁`'s output stack onto
`tm₂`'s input stack through a scratch stack, then runs `tm₂` and halts.  `tr` translates the
first machine's output symbols into the second machine's input symbols; `dflt` is the dummy
symbol demanded by the totality of `Turing.TM2.Stmt.push` on the unreachable empty-register
branches.  Nothing here asserts that it computes anything. -/
